# First-Project-Ideas
This repository will contain possible ideas of upcoming electrical design projects.

1. A phone case that covers the front and rear cameras and emits a white noise.
  - The purpose of the device is to provide privacy.
  - The front and rear camera will have a sliding cover that the user will have to manually move.
  - The case will include a small, lightweight microcontroller with a speaker like device attached it. This
    will ensure no unwanted speech or noise will be detected by the device.
  - The sound from the microcontroller will be strong enough to block any sound entering the phone's
    microphone but faint enough so it doesn't disturb the user.
  - This case will be powered by the phone through the charging port but will also allow for the case to
    have a charging port of its own.

2. An app or interface that allows for the user to have control over multiple items in a household; these items may include but not limited to a toaster, shower, electric kettle, oven, lights, tv, etc.
  - The initial project will be to activate said item.
  - There will also be a off feature.
  - This can be done through an interface with just a button with the name of the item next to it. This 
    button will have the function of turing on the device with one click and turning off the item with two
    clicks.
